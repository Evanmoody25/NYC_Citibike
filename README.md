# Overview of Project 

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

-Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

-Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

-Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

-Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

-Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

-Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

-Written Analysis

# Tools

-Jupyter Notebook, CSV, and Tableau

# Deliverable 1

Using Python and Pandas functions, you’ll convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After you convert the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, you’ll export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

Here lies the code I used in Jupyter Notebook to convert "tripduration."

Here lies the results of the code.

# Conclusion on Deliverable 1

As you can see, I have properly adjusted the "tripducation" data and am prepared to work on Deliverable 2.
